This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. Understanding churn behavior is vital for banks to retain valuable customers and improve long-term profitability. The dataset contains a variety of customer-level features, such as demographics, account status, credit score, and tenure, which were used to build predictive models.

The workflow started with thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions, correlations, class imbalance, and key patterns associated with customer churn. Data preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling were performed to prepare the data for modeling.

Multiple classification algorithms were trained and compared, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Gradient Boosting**. After cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, **Gradient Boosting** emerged as the best-performing model with an **accuracy of approximately 90%** and a **ROC-AUC score of 0.785** on the test set. These results indicate a strong balance between true positive and false positive rates, making the model well-suited for practical use in customer retention strategies.

Model evaluation was carried out using key metrics such as **accuracy**, **ROC-AUC**, and **confusion matrix**, giving a comprehensive view of each model's performance. Additionally, feature importance analysis from the Gradient Boosting model revealed the top drivers of churn, adding interpretability to the results and enabling actionable business insights.
