This project focuses on predicting bank customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset was thoroughly preprocessed using label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling. Multiple classification models—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained and evaluated based on accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC. After hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its superior ROC-AUC score of 0.802, reflecting strong discriminatory power. The final model, scaler, and feature list were serialized using pickle. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook, model files, app script, and all supporting components. It serves as a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a real-world classification problem.
